# Introduction | Wed Sep 30

- Display various algorithms eg. Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Abstract Data Types: higher level patterns for organising data structures - patterns for reading data from the structure, for removeing data, and for adding new data.

    Doesn't specify how it should be used

- Does it do what its supposed to?
- How long does it take?
- How much memory does it use?

## What is the Point
1. Programs must be correct 
    
    Not just bug-free, but an implementation of an algorithm must do exactly as its supposed to

2. Programs should be efficient

    - programs that take too long to run are useless
    
    - understand the implication of choosing certain library functions

    - implication of different design patterns
        
        - what may be easier for you to code may be much worse in runtime

## Efficiency
1. Faster machines means users expect to solve bigger problems

2. Some problems have known limits on their efficiency


## What is the Point part 2 Electric Boogaloo
3. You must advertise the code to other programmers *in terms they will understand*
    - state the ADTs used
      - programmers then know how to interact with them
    - state the data structures and algos you have used to implement ADTs

4. You should not break the design pattern
    - understand the specified ways to interact with the data 
    - don't interact with it inother ways etc etc...

[...](#abstract-data-types-higher-level-patterns-for-organising-data-structures---patterns-for-reading-data-from-the-structure-for-removeing-data-and-for-adding-new-data) and how do we implement it?

# We will use python3
    - understand lib funcs
    - learn how to implement structs in this lang
