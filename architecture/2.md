# Relational Algebra

## Projection

- $\pi$

- Deletes columns not in projection

- $\pi sid$

## Selection

- $\sigma$
- Select rows that satisfy selection condition
- No duplicate results

- $\pi sname, rating \sigma rating > 500$

## Union

- $\cup$

- Does stuff

## Set Diference

- $-$

- One table minus another

## Cross Product

- $X$
- Each row is paired with each row of the other table
- Result schea has one fe

## Joins
- Condition Join: $R \bowtie S = S == \sigma (R X S)$
- Result schema same as that of the cross-product
- Fewer tuples thatn cross product
- Sometimes called a theta-join
- Equi-Join: A special case of conditional join wheere the condition c contains only equalities and ^
- Natural Join: Equijoin on *all* comman fields

## Nested Loops Joins
Tuple-based nested loop $R\bowtie S$

    For each tuple r in R do
        For each tuple s in S do
            if r and s join then output( r, s)
    Cost: T(R) * T(S)
    KEY:
        T(R): Number of tuples in R
        ...             tuples in S

## Natural Join
- Meaning: R1$\bowtie$R2 = II =
